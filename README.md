# Omar's dotfiles
Configuration for the tools I use. I use a Mac, so this all assumes Mac stuff like homebrew.

## zsh
Nifty command prompt.

Lots of customizations to how the terminal works. Install it buy running `package.sh` in the directory,
then copying `.zshrc` and `.zsh-configs` to your home directory.

TODO: enumerate the customizations.

## VSCode
[Great modular text editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

TODO: add the extensions I've installed.

## Vim
Lots of plugins, shortcuts, theming.

Ensure [VimPlug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) is installed, then open Vim and run `:PlugInstall`.

## Kitty
[Better Mac Terminal Emulator](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/).

Fast, open-source terminal emulator.

## Dash
[Offline docs](https://kapeli.com/dash). Not much customization yet.
